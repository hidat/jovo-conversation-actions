#Jovo Conversation Actions
An example of using Jovo to develop a Google Conversational Actions application.

This action can display a list of tracks and play one of them.  
The tracks are taken from the KEXP Song of the Day Podcast
 
This application was used to learn the following:
* How to build/display a list
* How to playback media files and respond to playback events.
